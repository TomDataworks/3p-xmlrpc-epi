New in version 0.41
 - fix bug 440087, possible memory corruption if null is passed to XMLRPC_SetValueBase64
 - fix bug 433302. extra <param> in <fault>
 - fix system.methodSignature and system.methodHelp which were broken by introspection rewrite
 - fix endless loop in system.multiCall
 - add XMLRPC_GetVersionString() for library version info
 - add hello client/server, very simple examples.

New in version 0.40:
 - modified xmlrpc serialization code such that an extra array is no longer required when returning 
   vector data. Note that this has a small potential to break some existing apps, but it is 
   "the right thing".
 - re-wrote introspection API.  Now we use a smaller API and support describing methods via a 
   simple xml vocabulary.  This moves the model closer to javadoc, doc++, etc. Further, as a 
   performance feature, we now support introspection callbacks so that nothing is generated until 
   documentation is actually requested via one of the system.* methods.
 - fixed various samples that were written before the xml-rpc integration and were leading people astray.
 - added new API: XMLRPC_VectorRemoveValue()
 - added new API: XMLRPC_Free()
 - new/updated system methods:
    - system.getCapabilities()
    - system.multiCall ()
    - system.describeMethods ()
